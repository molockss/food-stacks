## How It's Made:

Tech used: EJS, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Passport, Cloudinary

Since moving to Dubai, I always get asked for recommendations on restaurants and cafes, so I built foodstacks, a social media app where you can share your favourite restaurants with others and explore the feed to find new experiences to add to your bookmarks.

I used EJS, to dynamically render each page.
I used Mongoose to structure user inputs to easily access information.
I used Bootstrap and utilized components to easily achieve a clean look
I used Passport for authentication to allow each user to access their own account, decide which of their creations is public, and access other public creations.
I used Google OAuth to allow users to sign in with their google account.
I used Cloudinary to manage user uploaded media.
I used MVC to structure my code.
